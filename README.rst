ExerPy: Exergy Analysis in Python
#################################

ExerPy is a Python library designed to perform detailed exergy analysis of
energy conversion systems. It builds on the exergy analysis methodology
implemented in TESPy, while extending its capabilities to seamlessly integrate
with simulation tools such as Ebsilon Professional, Aspen Plus, and TESPy itself.
ExerPy enables engineers and researchers to identify inefficiencies and optimize
the performance of thermodynamic systems through automated workflows and
consistent data handling.

With its advanced features, ExerPy calculates both physical and chemical exergy,
allowing users to analyze both individual components and entire systems. This
helps to identify where and why exergy losses occur, facilitating strategies to improve
efficiency, reduce costs, and support sustainable energy usage.

============
Installation
============
You can install the latest version of ExerPy using pip:

.. code:: bash

    pip install exerpy

===================
Quick Start Example
===================
Here's a simple example how to perform an exergy analysis using ExerPy:

Custom json
-----------

.. code:: python

    from exerpy import ExergyAnalysis

    model_path = 'my_model.json'

    ean = ExergyAnalysis.from_json(model_path, chemExLib='Ahrendts')

    fuel = {"inputs": ['Fuel'], "outputs": []}
    product = {"inputs": ['Power'], "outputs": []}

    ean.analyse(E_F=fuel, E_P=product)
    ean.exergy_results()

Exported tespy model
--------------------

.. code:: python

    from exerpy import ExergyAnalysis

    model_path = 'tespy_model_export.json'

    ean = ExergyAnalysis.from_tespy(model_path, chemExLib='Ahrendts')

    fuel = {"inputs": ['Fuel'], "outputs": []}
    product = {"inputs": ['Power'], "outputs": []}

    ean.analyse(E_F=fuel, E_P=product)
    ean.exergy_results()

You can also use a tespy network object instead!

Ebsilon model
-------------

.. code:: python

    from exerpy import ExergyAnalysis

    model_path = 'my_model.ebs'

    ean = ExergyAnalysis.from_ebsilon(model_path, chemExLib='Ahrendts')

    fuel = {"inputs": ['Fuel'], "outputs": []}
    product = {"inputs": ['Power'], "outputs": []}

    ean.analyse(E_F=fuel, E_P=product)
    ean.exergy_results()
