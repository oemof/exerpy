Thanks to Prof. Dr.-Ing. Fontina Petrakopoulou for the support and guidance.

A relevant part of the code for the exergoeconomic analysis is based on the work of
Friederike Roßberg (`@FriederikeTUB <https://github.com/FriederikeTUB/tespy-friederike>`__)
and has been adapted to fit the ExerPy framework.
